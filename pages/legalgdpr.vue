At IKR, we take data security very seriously. To us, the privacy and security of our customers is very important. It is for this reason that we protect personal data using appropriate physical, technical and organizational security measures in compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
<br><br>
The GDPR is a regulation in EU law that comes into effect on 25th May 2018 and it is designed to protect the privacy of all individuals within the EU. The Regulation makes sure that individuals have control over how their data is used and ensures that personal data is not exported out of the EU to countries that do not have adequate privacy laws.
<br><br>
IKR has been actively looking into the various provisions of the Regulation. We have put in place processes and procedures to make sure that we are fully compliant with the GDPR.
